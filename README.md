# Clone Mutator Lab

In this environment, you start with a few cells with randomized DNA.

Cells can die over time, but they can also reproduce by making perfect copies of themselves.

Cells that behave or look differently can only emerge when existing cells are submitted to particle radiation (represented by black dots), which add small mutations to their genes or, in some cases, kill the cell.

Radiation happens naturally, but you can bomb the specific area on the screen by clicking the left mouse button.

You can grow or shrink radiation scope by holding UP and DOWN keys.

If you want to clear a lot of cells at once, you can engage/disengage kill mode by clicking SPACE key.
